<h3 class="BestWorksHeader"> ABOUT ME</h3>
<br>
<p class="aboutMeDescription">
  My name is Prisha Emmanuel, and I currently a senior attending Poolesville High School in Poolesville, Maryland. 
</p>

<p class="aboutMeDescription">
  I started playing the piano at a very young age, I was signed up for lessons courtesy of my parents. At first I hated piano, but once I started my last year of middle school I found solace in music - the keys I pressed were manifestations of my emotion, taking the form of a melody. I found a similar sanction in singing, which I had been doing professionally since 5th grade. 
</p>

<p class="aboutMeDescription">
  When COVID-19 hit my first year of high school, I occupied myself with the task of learning the ukulele. My first experience using the audio production app Garageband was during this time. Seeing as our time in class was cut short due to the pandemic, my friend and I decided to write a song for our eighth-grade geometry teacher. We collaborated on the lyrics, and I attempted to record the song on Garageband so that I could send it to her. The app intrigued me. I saw foreign buttons to press that all had vastly different functions, and I wanted to discover how to use them in conversation with each other, to create a song. So I quickly picked up the acoustic guitar, to accompany me while I sang covers of popular songs and continued writing originals, all whilst satisfying my curiosity by exploring the depths of Garageband.

<p class="aboutMeDescription">
 Combining my passion for aviation and filmmaking has allowed me to produce some remarkable trailers and flight time lapses for Infinite Flight. Check them out above!
</p>


<p class="aboutMeDescription">
  What started as a spontaneous dip into the vast ocean of songwriting and music production has since become a serious hobby of mine. I have created over 250 projects (covers and originals), both on Garageband and off. This website aims to document my journey as a vocal artist, musician, and music producer, as well as showcase some of my best works. Throughout the years, I’ve improved my skills through trial and error, teaching myself new techniques and skills, all the while never losing the inexplicable joy I find in the process of creating music.
